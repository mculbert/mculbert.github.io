I am a mixed-methods social science research methodologist with a focus on
education. Currently, I lead a research study of
[The Discussion Project](https://discussion.education.wisc.edu/) at the
[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison School of Education](https://education.wisc.edu/),
in the [Wisconsin Center for Education Research](https://www.wcer.wisc.edu/).
For more information about my work, see my
[CV](https://wisc.academia.edu/MichaelJCulbertson/CurriculumVitae).

# What's a "cogitorium"?

As I described in the first post on the original Cogitorium
(["What's in a name?"](https://cogitorium.blogspot.com/2007/06/whats-in-name.html)),
the name derives from the Latin
_[cogitatorium](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcogitatorium)_{: lang="la"},
which Lewis &amp; Short define as "a receptacle of thought." This site
serves as a holding tank for thoughts, a sporadic and eclectic collection of
ideas that may or may not be worth sharing. It is a continuation of the
original [Cogitorium](https://cogitorium.blogspot.com) and
[Cogitorium on Education](https://edu-cogitorium.blogspot.com) on Blogger.
